## Installation
### SeqRanker
Individual dbDNA databases can be created using the SeqRanker pipeline, which can be installed on all common operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS). SeqRanker requires Python 3.7 or higher and can be easily installed via pip in any command line:

`pip3 install seqranker`

To update SeqRanker run:

`pip3 install --upgrade seqranker`
